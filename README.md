## ⚡ What is Contri-AI?

Contri-AI is a **Web3-native analytics and incentive distribution platform** designed to solve fairness problems in hackathons, airdrops, and community incentive programs.

At its core lies the **Proof of Dynamic Contribution (PoDC)** mechanism — an AI-driven scoring engine that evaluates contributions across multiple dimensions (GitHub commits, Discord activity, research quality, social engagement, etc.). This makes contribution recognition more **transparent, resilient to Sybil attacks, and rewarding for genuine contributors.**
