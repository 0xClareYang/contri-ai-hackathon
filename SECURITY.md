## Reporting a Vulnerability

### For Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in Contri-AI, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email**: Send details to the repository owner privately
3. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 7 days  
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed

## Security Considerations

### Frontend Security

Since this is a frontend-only React application, security considerations include:

#### Client-Side Security
- **XSS Prevention**: All user inputs are sanitized
- **Content Security Policy**: Recommended for production deployment
- **Dependency Security**: Regular npm audit checks
- **Bundle Analysis**: No sensitive data in client bundles

#### Data Handling
- **No Sensitive Storage**: No credentials stored in localStorage/sessionStorage
- **Mock Data Only**: All data is simulated for demo purposes
- **API Security**: When connecting real APIs, use proper authentication

### Deployment Security

#### Vercel Deployment
- **HTTPS**: All traffic encrypted by default
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive config stored securely
- **Build Security**: Source code not exposed in production
- **CDN Security**: Global distribution with security headers

#### Security Headers
Recommended security headers for production:
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### Development Security

#### Dependencies
- **npm audit**: Run regularly to check for vulnerabilities
- **Dependabot**: Automated security updates (when available)
- **Version Pinning**: Lock dependency versions for consistency

#### Code Security
- **TypeScript**: Type safety prevents many runtime errors  
- **Linting**: ESLint rules catch potential security issues
- **No Secrets**: Never commit API keys or credentials

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
1. **Code Review**: All changes reviewed before merging
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies current
3. **Security Testing**: Test for XSS and injection vulnerabilities
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors

### For Deployments
1. **Environment Separation**: Separate dev/staging/production environments
2. **Access Control**: Limit deployment access to authorized users
3. **Monitoring**: Log and monitor for unusual activity
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep runtime and dependencies updated

### For Users
1. **Browser Security**: Use up-to-date browsers
2. **Network Security**: Avoid public/untrusted networks for sensitive use
3. **Local Security**: Keep development machines secure

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Responsible Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Initial report kept confidential
2. **Coordination**: Work with reporter to understand impact
3. **Fix Development**: Develop and test security fixes
4. **Public Disclosure**: Announce fix after deployment
5. **Credit**: Recognize security researchers (with permission)

### Public Security Advisories
Security issues will be documented in:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- CHANGELOG.md security section
- Release notes for fixes

## Incident Response

### Response Team
- **Primary**: Repository owner (0xClareYang)
- **Technical**: Development team
- **Communication**: Community management

### Response Process
1. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
2. **Containment**: Immediate steps to limit exposure
3. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
4. **Resolution**: Implement and deploy fixes
5. **Communication**: Notify affected users
6. **Documentation**: Update security documentation

## Security Resources

### Tools and References
